VideoDB-Cleaner
===============

> Current version: v1.0.1

VideoDB-Cleaner removes entries from the Video-DB that refer to external sources which ensures that the Kodi database cleanup runs fast and efficiently as those sources will not have to be scanned one by one during this process.

Download the Repository from [HERE](http://raw.github.com/bluezed/repository.bluezed/master/zips/repository.bluezed/repository.bluezed-1.1.zip)

Here are the basic steps to install VideoDB-Cleaner on your Kodi box.

# Prerequisites
* Kodi 16 or higher
* The downloaded Repository Zip-file
* Place the file somewhere you can get to easily on your Kodi box

# Installation
1. Go to System -> Addons and select "Install from Zip-file"                                          

2. Select the Zip file you downloaded earlier. This should install the Bluezed Repository on your box.

3. Now go to "Install from repository" and then "Bluezed Repository"                                                                   

4. Go to "Progrm add-ons" and select "VideoDB-Cleaner"                                      

5. A window should open where you need to select "Install"                                              

This should now install Addon on your system and will be located under "Programs".

The Cleaner runs as a background service after you restart Kodi and will trigger automatically every 24 hours.
You can also manually start the cleaner as a one-off by going to your Program Addons and selecting "VideoDB-Cleaner" there.
The service can be disabled in the addon settings.
